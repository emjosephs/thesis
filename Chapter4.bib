                 individual proteins to characterizing global cellular factors.
                 Systematic surveys indicate that protein evolution is not
                 determined exclusively by selection on protein structure and
                 function, but is also affected by the genomic position of the
                 encoding genes, their expression patterns, their position in

                 mistranslation. Recent work has allowed insights into the

                 production of anthocyanin pigments in plant tissues and shares
                 a number of enzymes with other biochemical pathways. The six
                 core structural genes of this pathway have been cloned and
                 characterized in two taxonomically diverse plant species
                 (maize and snapdragon). We have recently cloned these genes
                 for a third species, the common morning glory, Ipomoea
                 purpurea. This additional information provides an opportunity
                 to examine patterns of evolution among genes within a single
                 biochemical pathway. We report here that upstream genes in the
                 anthocyanin pathway have evolved substantially more slowly
                 than downstream genes and suggest that this difference in
                 evolutionary rates may be explained by upstream genes being
                 more constrained because they participate in several different
                 biochemical pathways. In addition, regulatory genes associated
                 with the anthocyanin pathway tend to evolve more rapidly than
                 the structural genes they regulate, suggesting that adaptive
                 evolution of flower color may be mediated more by regulatory
                 than by structural genes. Finally, for individual anthocyanin
                 genes, we found an absence of rate heterogeneity among three
                 major angiosperm lineages. This rate constancy contrasts with
                 an accelerated rate of evolution of three CHS-like genes in
                 the Ipomoea lineage, indicating that these three genes have
                 diverged without coordinated adjustment by other pathway

                 has a substantial impact on genomic patterns of polymorphism
                 and divergence. However, species with smaller population sizes
                 and/or stronger population structure may not be expected to
                 exhibit Drosophila-like patterns of sequence variation. We
                 test this prediction and identify determinants of levels of
                 polymorphism and rates of protein evolution using genomic data
                 from Arabidopsis thaliana and the recently sequenced
                 Arabidopsis lyrata genome. We find that, in contrast to
                 Drosophila, there is no negative relationship between
                 nonsynonymous divergence and silent polymorphism at any
                 spatial scale examined. Instead, synonymous divergence is a
                 major predictor of silent polymorphism, which suggests
                 variation in mutation rate as the main determinant of silent
                 variation. Variation in rates of protein divergence is mainly
                 correlated with gene expression level and breadth, consistent
                 with results for a broad range of taxa, and map-based
                 estimates of recombination rate are only weakly correlated
                 with nonsynonymous divergence. Variation in mutation rates and
                 the strength of purifying selection seem to be major drivers
                 of patterns of polymorphism and divergence in Arabidopsis.
                 Nevertheless, a model allowing for varying negative and
                 positive selection by functional gene category explains the
                 data better than a homogeneous model, implying the action of
                 positive selection on a subset of genes. Genes involved in
                 disease resistance and abiotic stress display high proportions

                 is a central problem in molecular evolution. Methods to
                 estimate the fraction of adaptive nucleotide substitutions
                 (alpha) have been developed, based on the McDonald-Kreitman
                 test, that contrast polymorphism and divergence between
                 selectively and neutrally evolving sites. However, these
                 methods are expected to give downwardly biased estimates of
                 alpha if there are slightly deleterious mutations, because
                 these inflate polymorphism relative to divergence. Here, we
                 estimate alpha by simultaneously estimating the distribution
                 of fitness effects of new mutations at selected sites from the
                 site frequency spectrum and the number of adaptive
                 substitutions. We test the method using simulations. If data
                 meet the assumptions of the analysis model, estimates of alpha
                 show little bias, even when there is little or no
                 recombination. However, population size differences between
                 the divergence and polymorphism phases may cause alpha to be
                 over or underestimated by a predictable factor that depends on
                 the magnitude of the population size change and the shape of
                 the distribution of effects of deleterious mutations. We
                 analyze several data sets of protein-coding genes and
                 noncoding regions from hominids and Drosophila. In Drosophila
                 genes, we estimate that approximately 50\% of amino acid
                 substitutions and approximately 20\% of substitutions in
                 introns are adaptive. In protein-coding and noncoding data
                 sets of humans, comparison to macaque sequences reveals little
                 evidence for adaptive substitutions. However, the true
                 frequency of adaptive substitutions in human-coding DNA could
                 be as high as 40\%, because estimates based on current
                 polymorphism may be strongly downwardly biased by a decrease

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Most studies of molecular evolution are focused on
                 individual genes and proteins. However, understanding the
                 design principles and evolutionary properties of molecular
                 networks requires a system-wide perspective. In the present
                 work we connect molecular evolution on the gene level with
                 system properties of a cellular metabolic network. In contrast
                 to protein interaction networks, where several previous
                 studies investigated the molecular evolution of proteins,
                 metabolic networks have a relatively well-defined global
                 function. The ability to consider fluxes in a metabolic
                 network allows us to relate the functional role of each enzyme
                 in a network to its rate of evolution. RESULTS: Our results,
                 based on the yeast metabolic network, demonstrate that
                 important evolutionary processes, such as the fixation of
                 single nucleotide mutations, gene duplications, and gene
                 deletions, are influenced by the structure and function of the
                 network. Specifically, central and highly connected enzymes
                 evolve more slowly than less connected enzymes. Also, enzymes
                 carrying high metabolic fluxes under natural biological
                 conditions experience higher evolutionary constraints. Genes
                 encoding enzymes with high connectivity and high metabolic
                 flux have higher chances to retain duplicates in evolution. In
                 contrast to protein interaction networks, highly connected
                 enzymes are no more likely to be essential compared to less
                 connected enzymes. CONCLUSION: The presented analysis of
                 evolutionary constraints, gene duplication, and essentiality
                 demonstrates that the structure and function of a metabolic
                 network shapes the evolution of its enzymes. Our results

                 regulating physiological responses and developmental
                 processes. Here we examine the evolution of the yeast
                 transcription factors in the context of the structure of the
                 gene regulatory network. RESULTS: In contrast to previous
                 results for the protein-protein interaction and metabolic
                 networks, we find that the position of a gene within the
                 transcription network affects the rate of protein evolution
                 such that more central transcription factors tend to evolve
                 faster. Centrality is also positively correlated with
                 expression variability, suggesting that the higher rate of
                 divergence among central transcription factors may be due to
                 their role in controlling information flow and may be the
                 result of adaptation to changing environmental conditions.
                 Alternatively, more central transcription factors could be
                 more buffered against environmental perturbations and,
                 therefore, less subject to strong purifying selection.
                 Importantly, the relationship between centrality and
                 evolutionary rates is independent of expression level,
                 expression variability and gene essentiality. CONCLUSIONS: Our
                 analysis of the transcription network highlights the role of
                 network structure on protein evolutionary rate. Further, the
                 effect of network centrality on nucleotide divergence is
                 different among the metabolic, protein-protein and
                 transcriptional networks, suggesting that the effect of gene
                 position is dependant on the function of the specific network
                 under study. A better understanding of how these three
                 cellular networks interact with one another may be needed to

                 across different portions of plant genomes remains poorly
                 understood. Here, we sequence whole genomes of 13 Capsella
                 grandiflora individuals and quantify the amount of selection
                 across the genome. Using an estimate of the distribution of
                 fitness effects, we show that selection is strong in coding
                 regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, with the
                 exception of 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). However,
                 estimates of selection on noncoding regions conserved across
                 the Brassicaceae family show strong signals of selection.
                 Additionally, we see reductions in neutral diversity around
                 functional substitutions in both coding and conserved
                 noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these
                 sites. Finally, using expression data from leaf tissue we show
                 that genes that are more highly expressed experience stronger
                 negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection

              One hypothesis suggests that variation is maintained by a balance
              between new mutations and their removal by selection and drift.
              Theory predicts that this mutation-selection balance will result
              in an excess of low-frequency variants and a negative correlation
              between minor allele frequency and selection coefficients. Here,

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that rates of protein
                 evolution are influenced, to a great extent, by the proportion
                 of amino acid residues that are directly involved in protein
                 function. In agreement with this hypothesis, recent work has
                 shown a negative correlation between evolutionary rates and
                 the number of protein-protein interactions. However, the
                 extent to which the number of protein-protein interactions
                 influences evolutionary rates remains unclear. Here, we
                 address this question at several different levels of
                 evolutionary relatedness. RESULTS: Manually curated data on
                 the number of protein-protein interactions among Saccharomyces
                 cerevisiae proteins was examined for possible correlation with
                 evolutionary rates between S. cerevisiae and
                 Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologs. Only a very weak negative
                 correlation between the number of interactions and
                 evolutionary rate of a protein was observed. Furthermore, no
                 relationship was found between a more general measure of the
                 evolutionary conservation of S. cerevisiae proteins, based on
                 the taxonomic distribution of their homologs, and the number
                 of protein-protein interactions. However, when the proteins
                 from yeast were assorted into discrete bins according to the
                 number of interactions, it turned out that 6.5\% of the
                 proteins with the greatest number of interactions evolved, on
                 average, significantly slower than the rest of the proteins.
                 Comparisons were also performed using protein-protein
                 interaction data obtained with high-throughput analysis of
                 Helicobacter pylori proteins. No convincing relationship
                 between the number of protein-protein interactions and
                 evolutionary rates was detected, either for comparisons of
                 orthologs from two completely sequenced H. pylori strains or
                 for comparisons of H. pylori and Campylobacter jejuni
                 orthologs, even when the proteins were classified into bins by
                 the number of interactions. CONCLUSION: The currently
                 available comparative-genomic data do not support the
                 hypothesis that the evolutionary rates of the majority of
                 proteins substantially depend on the number of protein-protein
                 interactions they are involved in. However, a small fraction
                 of yeast proteins with the largest number of interactions (the
                 hubs of the interaction network) tend to evolve slower than
                 the bulk of the proteins.",

                 network) previously reported to have independent influences on
                 protein evolutionary rates. Strikingly, our analysis reveals a
                 single dominant variable linked to the number of translation
                 events which explains 40-fold more variation in evolutionary
                 rate than any other, suggesting that protein evolutionary rate
                 has a single major determinant among the seven predictors. The
                 dominant variable explains nearly half the variation in the

                 a variety of tools have been developed that support exploring
                 and searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of
                 tools that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently
                 available. Most of these tools require as input a target set
                 of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the
                 target set compared to the background set. A few tools also
                 exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter
                 typically rely on simulations or on union-bound correction for
                 assigning statistical significance to the results. RESULTS:
                 GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO
                 terms in ranked lists of genes, without requiring the user to
                 provide explicit target and background sets. This is
                 particularly useful in many typical cases where genomic data
                 may be naturally represented as a ranked list of genes (e.g.
                 by level of expression or of differential expression). GOrilla
                 employs a flexible threshold statistical approach to discover
                 GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a
                 ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical
                 characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG,
                 GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment,
                 taking threshold multiple testing into account without the
                 need for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical
                 analysis of thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in
                 order of seconds. The output of the enrichment analysis is
                 visualized as a hierarchical structure, providing a clear view
                 of the relations between enriched GO terms. CONCLUSION:
                 GOrilla is an efficient GO analysis tool with unique features
                 that make a useful addition to the existing repertoire of GO
                 enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique features and advantages
                 over other threshold free enrichment tools include rigorous
                 statistics, fast running time and an effective graphical

                 The genomic factors that determine adaptability, however,
                 remain poorly understood. Genes function in the context of
                 molecular networks, with some occupying more important
                 positions than others and thus being likely to be under

                 been targeted by recent positive selection during recent human

                 to evolve more slowly if they encode enzymes upstream as
                 opposed to downstream in metabolic pathways, because upstream
                 genes are more pleiotropic, being required for a wider range
                 of end products. However, few clear examples of this trend in
                 evolutionary rate variation exist. We examined whether genes
                 involved in plant terpenoid biosynthesis exhibit such a
                 pattern, using data for 40 genes from five fully sequenced
                 angiosperms, Oryza, Vitis, Arabidopsis, Populus, and Ricinus.
                 Our results show that d(N)/d(S) does in fact correlate with
                 pathway position along pathways converting glucose to the
                 terpenoid phytohormones abscissic acid, gibberellic acid (GA),
                 and brassinosteroids. Upstream versus downstream rate
                 variation is particularly strong in the GA pathway. In
                 contrast, we found no or little apparent variation in
                 d(N)/d(S) with gene copy number. We also introduce a new
                 measure of pathway position, the Pathway Pleiotropy Index
                 (PPI), which counts groups of enzymes between pathway branch
                 points. We found that this measure is superior to pathway
                 position in explaining variation in d(N)/d(S) along each
                 pathway. Although at least 8 of the 40 genes showed evidence
                 of positive selection, correlations of d(N)/d(S) with PPI
                 remain significant when these genes are removed. Therefore,
                 our results are consistent with the prediction that selective

                 Recently, however, a critical role for physical principles of
                 network self-organization in biological systems has been
                 revealed. Here, we employ a systems level view of genome-scale
                 sequence and expression data to examine the interplay between
                 these two sources of order, natural selection and physical
                 self-organization, in the evolution of human gene regulation.
                 The topology of a human gene coexpression network, derived
                 from tissue-specific expression profiles, shows scale-free
                 properties that imply evolutionary self-organization via
                 preferential node attachment. Genes with numerous coexpressed
                 partners (the hubs of the coexpression network) evolve more
                 slowly on average than genes with fewer coexpressed partners,
                 and genes that are coexpressed show similar rates of
                 evolution. Thus, the strength of selective constraints on gene
                 sequences is affected by the topology of the gene coexpression
                 network. This connection is strong for the coding regions and
                 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), but the 5' UTRs appear to
                 evolve under a different regime. Surprisingly, we found no
                 connection between the rate of gene sequence divergence and
                 the extent of gene expression profile divergence between human
                 and mouse. This suggests that distinct modes of natural
                 selection might govern sequence versus expression divergence,
                 and we propose a model, based on rapid, adaptation-driven
                 divergence and convergent evolution of gene expression
                 patterns, for how natural selection could influence gene

                 connected hub proteins, largely responsible for maintaining

                 investigate the properties of weighted gene co-expression
                 networks formed from multiple microarray datasets. The
                 constructed networks approximate scale-free topology, but this

                 conservation. We demonstrate the preservation of a modular

                 enzymes. One characteristic that may affect rate heterogeneity
                 is control of the amount of product produced by a biochemical
                 pathway or flux control. In particular, theoretical analyses
                 suggest that adaptive substitutions should be concentrated in
                 the enzyme(s) that exert the greatest control over flux.
                 Although a handful of studies have found a correlation between
                 position in a pathway and evolutionary rate, these
                 investigations have not examined the relationship between
                 evolutionary rate and flux control. Given that genes with
                 greater control will experience stronger selection and that
                 the probability of fixation is proportional to the selective
                 advantage, we ask the following: 1) do upstream enzymes have
                 majority flux control, 2) do enzymes with majority flux
                 control accumulate adaptive substitutions, and 3) are upstream

                 perturbing the enzymes in the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway
                 in Arabidopsis thaliana with gene insertion lines, we show
                 that flux control is focused in the first enzyme in the
                 pathway. Next, by analyzing several sequence signatures of
                 selection, we also show that this enzyme is the only one in
                 the pathway that shows convincing evidence of selection. Our

                 genetic variation and adaptive evolution in the primate
                 lineage have become major research foci. Here, we examine the
                 relationship between genetic signatures of adaptive evolution
                 and network topology. We find a striking tendency of proteins
                 that have been under positive selection (as compared with the
                 chimpanzee) to be located at the periphery of the interaction
                 network. Our results are based on the analysis of two types of
                 genome evolution, both in terms of intra- and interspecies
                 variation. First, we looked at single-nucleotide polymorphisms
                 and their fixed variants, single-nucleotide differences in the
                 human genome relative to the chimpanzee. Second, we examine
                 fixed structural variants, specifically large segmental
                 duplications and their polymorphic precursors known as copy
                 number variants. We propose two complementary mechanisms that
                 lead to the observed trends. First, we can rationalize them in
                 terms of constraints imposed by protein structure: We find
                 that positively selected sites are preferentially located on
                 the exposed surface of proteins. Because central network
                 proteins (hubs) are likely to have a larger fraction of their
                 surface involved in interactions, they tend to be constrained
                 and under negative selection. Conversely, we show that the
                 interaction network roughly maps to cellular organization,
                 with the periphery of the network corresponding to the
                 cellular periphery (i.e., extracellular space or cell
                 membrane). This suggests that the observed positive selection
                 at the network periphery may be due to an increase of adaptive
                 events on the cellular periphery responding to changing

                 shaping patterns of evolutionary variation in any of the

                 highlight fundamental relationships among genomic attributes

                 protein divergence is positively coupled with both gene
                 expression polymorphism and divergence. We show moreover that
                 although the number of protein-protein interactions in
                 Drosophila is negatively associated with protein divergence as
                 well as gene expression polymorphism and divergence,
                 protein-protein interactions cannot account for the observed
                 coupling between regulatory and structural evolution.
                 Furthermore, we show that proteins with higher rates of amino
                 acid substitutions tend to have larger sizes and tend to be
                 expressed at lower mRNA abundances, whereas genes with higher
                 levels of gene expression divergence and polymorphism tend to
                 have shorter sizes and tend to be expressed at higher mRNA
                 abundances. Finally, we show that protein length is negatively
                 associated with both number of protein-protein interactions
                 and mRNA abundance and that interacting proteins in Drosophila
                 show similar amounts of divergence. We suggest that protein
                 sequences and gene expression are subjected to similar
                 evolutionary dynamics, possibly because of similarity in the

                 biological traits and how they are integrated over time to

                 different rates and possess markedly varying levels of
                 molecular polymorphism, codon bias and expression variation.
                 Discovering the underlying causes of this variation has been a
                 challenge in evolutionary biology. It has been proposed that
                 both the intrinsic properties of enzymes and their pathway
                 position have direct effects on their molecular evolution, and
                 with the genomic era the study of adaptation has been taken to
                 the level of pathways and networks of genes and their
                 products. Of special interest have been the energy-producing
                 pathways. Using both population genetic and experimental
                 approaches, our laboratory has been engaged in a study of
                 molecular variation across the glycolytic pathway in
                 Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives. We have

                 6-phosphate, show evidence for both contemporary selection, in
                 the form of latitudinal allele clines, and inter-specific
                 selection, in the form of elevated levels of amino acid
                 substitutions between species. To further explore this

                 broad-tailed distributions are observed because they confer
                 robustness against mutations to the network. We evaluate this
                 hypothesis for two genetic networks, that of the E. coli core
                 intermediary metabolism and that of the yeast
                 protein-interaction network. Specifically, we test the
                 hypothesis through one of its key predictions: highly
                 connected proteins should be more important to the cell and,
                 thus, subject to more severe selective and evolutionary
                 constraints. We find, however, that no correlation between
                 highly connected proteins and evolutionary rate exists in the

                 genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription show
                 significant correlations. Our work sheds light on conflicting
                 results by previous researchers by comparing data from
                 multiple types of protein-interaction datasets and by using a
                 closely related species as a reference taxon. The finding that
                 highly connected proteins can tolerate just as many amino acid

                 functional module, networks of coexpressed genes provide one
                 framework for assigning gene function. This has informed the
                 guilt-by-association (GBA) heuristic, widely invoked in
                 functional genomics. Yet although the idea of GBA is accepted,
                 the breadth of GBA applicability is uncertain. RESULTS: We
                 developed methods to systematically explore the breadth of GBA
                 across a large and varied corpus of expression data to answer
                 the following question: To what extent is the GBA heuristic
                 broadly applicable to the transcriptome and conversely how
                 broadly is GBA captured by a priori knowledge represented in
                 the Gene Ontology (GO)? Our study provides an investigation of
                 the functional organization of five coexpression networks
                 using data from three mammalian organisms. Our method
                 calculates a probabilistic score between each gene and each
                 Gene Ontology category that reflects coexpression enrichment
                 of a GO module. For each GO category we use Receiver Operating
                 Curves to assess whether these probabilistic scores reflect
                 GBA. This methodology applied to five different coexpression
                 networks demonstrates that the signature of
                 guilt-by-association is ubiquitous and reproducible and that
                 the GBA heuristic is broadly applicable across the population
                 of nine hundred Gene Ontology categories. We also demonstrate
                 the existence of highly reproducible patterns of coexpression
                 between some pairs of GO categories. CONCLUSION: We conclude
                 that GBA has universal value and that transcriptional control
                 may be more modular than previously realized. Our analyses
                 also suggest that methodologies combining coexpression
                 measurements across multiple genes in a biologically-defined
                 module can aid in characterizing gene function or in

                 system is one of the functions enriched with genes under
                 adaptive selection. RESULTS: Here, we describe how the innate

                 positive or balancing selection in each population detected by
                 neutrality tests and showed that some functional classes are
                 preferential targets for selection. CONCLUSIONS: We found
                 evidence that the role of each gene in the network conditions
                 the capacity to evolve or their evolvability: genes at the
                 core of the network are more constrained, while adaptation
                 mostly occurred at particular positions at the network edges.
                 Interestingly, the functional classes containing most of the
                 genes with signatures of balancing selection are involved in
                 autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, suggesting a
                 counterbalance between the beneficial and deleterious effects
                 of the immune response.",

  abstract    = "The evolutionary rates of proteins vary over several orders of
                 magnitude. Recent work suggests that analysis of large data
                 sets of evolutionary rates in conjunction with the results
                 from high-throughput functional genomic experiments can
                 identify the factors that cause proteins to evolve at such
                 dramatically different rates. To this end, we estimated the
                 evolutionary rates of >3,000 proteins in four species of the
                 yeast genus Saccharomyces and investigated their relationship
                 with levels of expression and protein dispensability. Each
                 protein's dispensability was estimated by the growth rate of
                 mutants deficient for the protein. Our analyses of these
                 improved evolutionary and functional genomic data sets yield
                 three main results. First, dispensability and expression have
                 independent, significant effects on the rate of protein
                 evolution. Second, measurements of expression levels in the
                 laboratory can be used to filter data sets of dispensability
                 estimates, removing variates that are unlikely to reflect real
                 biological effects. Third, structural equation models show
                 that although we may reasonably infer that dispensability and
                 expression have significant effects on protein evolutionary
                 rate, we cannot yet accurately estimate the relative strengths
                 of these effects.",
