  abstract    = "The goal of identifying the genes or even nucleotides
                 underlying quantitative and adaptive traits has been
                 characterized as the 'QTN programme' and has recently come
                 under severe criticism. Part of the reason for this criticism
                 is that much of the QTN programme has asserted that finding
                 the genes and nucleotides for adaptive and quantitative traits
                 is a fundamental goal, without explaining why it is such a
                 hallowed goal. Here we outline motivations for the QTN
                 programme that offer general insight, regardless of whether
                 QTNs are of large or small effect, and that aid our
                 understanding of the mechanistic dynamics of adaptive
                 evolution. We focus on five areas: (i) vertical integration of
                 insight across different levels of biological organization,
                 (ii) genetic parallelism and the role of pleiotropy in shaping
                 evolutionary dynamics, (iii) understanding the forces
                 maintaining genetic variation in populations, (iv)
                 distinguishing between adaptation from standing variation and
                 new mutation, and (v) the role of genomic architecture in
                 facilitating adaptation. We argue that rather than abandoning
                 the QTN programme, we should refocus our efforts on topics
                 where molecular data will be the most effective for testing
                 hypotheses about phenotypic evolution.",

                 known examples in which selection has been shown to act
                 directly on levels or patterns of gene expression. In order to
                 test whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
                 affect gene expression in cis are frequently targets of
                 positive natural selection in humans, we analyzed genome-wide
                 SNP and expression data from cell lines associated with the
                 International HapMap Project. Using a haplotype-based test for
                 selection that was designed to detect incomplete selective
                 sweeps, we found that SNPs showing signals of selection are
                 more likely than random SNPs to be associated with gene
                 expression levels in cis. This signal is significant in the
                 Yoruba (which is the population that shows the strongest
                 signals of selection overall) and shows a trend in the same
                 direction in the other HapMap populations. Our results argue
                 that selection on gene expression levels is an important type
                 of human adaptation. Finally, our work provides an analytical
                 framework for tackling a more general problem that will become
                 increasingly important: namely, testing whether selection

                 adaptive evolution within protein-coding genes in a variety of
                 species. However, with the exception of Drosophila and humans,
                 little is known about the extent of adaptive evolution in
                 noncoding DNA. Here, we study regions upstream and downstream
                 of protein-coding genes in the house mouse Mus musculus
                 castaneus, a species that has a much larger effective
                 population size (N(e)) than humans. We analyze polymorphism
                 data for 78 genes from 15 wild-caught M. m. castaneus
                 individuals and divergence to a closely related species, Mus
                 famulus. We find high levels of nucleotide diversity and
                 moderate levels of selective constraint in upstream and
                 downstream regions compared with nonsynonymous sites of
                 protein-coding genes. From the polymorphism data, we estimate
                 the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations and
                 infer that most new mutations in upstream and downstream
                 regions behave as effectively neutral and that only a small
                 fraction is strongly negatively selected. We also estimate the
                 fraction of substitutions that have been driven to fixation by
                 positive selection ($\alpha$) and the ratio of adaptive to
                 neutral divergence ($\omega$($\alpha$)). We find that $\alpha$
                 for upstream and downstream regions (âˆ¼ 10\%) is much lower
                 than $\alpha$ for nonsynonymous sites (âˆ¼ 50\%). However,
                 $\omega$($\alpha$) estimates are very similar for
                 nonsynonymous sites (âˆ¼ 10\%) and upstream and downstream
                 regions (âˆ¼ 5\%). We conclude that negative selection operating
                 in upstream and downstream regions of M. m. castaneus is weak
                 and that the low values of $\alpha$ for upstream and
                 downstream regions relative to nonsynonymous sites are most
                 likely due to the presence of a higher proportion of neutrally
                 evolving sites and not due to lower absolute rates of adaptive
                 substitution.",

                 genetics. However, inferring population structure in large
                 modern data sets imposes severe computational challenges.
                 Here, we develop efficient algorithms for approximate
                 inference of the model underlying the STRUCTURE program using
                 a variational Bayesian framework. Variational methods pose the
                 problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an
                 optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances
                 in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In
                 addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the
                 number of populations represented in a data set and a new
                 hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the
                 data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data and
                 illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH-Human Genome

                 orders of magnitude faster than STRUCTURE and achieve
                 accuracies comparable to those of ADMIXTURE. Furthermore, our

                 complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number

                 still elusive. Compiling environmental correlation data from
                 three studies for more than 500,000 SNPs and 42 environmental
                 factors, including climate, subsistence, pathogens, and
                 dietary patterns, we performed a systematic examination of the

                 studies have found convincing evidence for adaptive amino acid
                 substitution in plants. To assess the generality of this
                 finding, we have sequenced 257 loci in the outcrossing
                 crucifer Capsella grandiflora, which has a large effective
                 population size and low population structure. Using a new
                 method that jointly infers selective and demographic effects,
                 we estimate that 40\% of amino acid substitutions were fixed
                 by positive selection in this species, and we also infer a low
                 proportion of slightly deleterious amino acid mutations. We
                 contrast these estimates with those for a similar data set
                 from the closely related Arabidopsis thaliana and find
                 significantly higher rates of adaptive evolution and fewer
                 nearly neutral mutations in C. grandiflora. In agreement with
                 results for other taxa, genes involved in reproduction show
                 the strongest evidence for positive selection in C.

                 positive and purifying selection are more effective in C.

                 contrasting demographic history and effective population sizes

                 address this question for humans specifically from the
                 perspective of population allele frequency of variants across
                 the complete genome, including both coding and noncoding
                 regions. We establish simple criteria to assess the likelihood
                 that variants are functional based on their genomic locations
                 and then use whole-genome sequence data from 29 subjects of
                 European origin to assess the relationship between the
                 functional properties of variants and their population allele
                 frequencies. We find that for all criteria used to assess the
                 likelihood that a variant is functional, the rarer variants
                 are significantly more likely to be functional than the more
                 common variants. Strikingly, these patterns disappear when we
                 focus on only those variants in which the major alleles are
                 derived. These analyses indicate that the majority of the
                 genetic variation in terms of phenotypic consequence may
                 result from a mutation-selection balance, as opposed to

                 We conducted an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based study of

                 for achieving this goal. Although all eQTL studies so far have
                 assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays,
                 recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of
                 transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced
                 RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated
                 Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by
                 the International HapMap Project. By pooling data from all
                 individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional

                 that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is

                 least 2,000 common variants that appear associated with common
                 diseases or related traits (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies),
                 hundreds of which have been convincingly replicated. It is
                 generally thought that the associated markers reflect the
                 effect of a nearby common (minor allele frequency >0.05)
                 causal site, which is associated with the marker, leading to
                 extensive resequencing efforts to find causal sites. We
                 propose as an alternative explanation that variants much less
                 common than the associated one may create ``synthetic
                 associations'' by occurring, stochastically, more often in
                 association with one of the alleles at the common site versus
                 the other allele. Although synthetic associations are an
                 obvious theoretical possibility, they have never been
                 systematically explored as a possible explanation for GWAS
                 findings. Here, we use simple computer simulations to show the
                 conditions under which such synthetic associations will arise
                 and how they may be recognized. We show that they are not only
                 possible, but inevitable, and that under simple but reasonable
                 genetic models, they are likely to account for or contribute
                 to many of the recently identified signals reported in
                 genome-wide association studies. We also illustrate the
                 behavior of synthetic associations in real datasets by showing
                 that rare causal mutations responsible for both hearing loss
                 and sickle cell anemia create genome-wide significant
                 synthetic associations, in the latter case extending over a
                 2.5-Mb interval encompassing scores of ``blocks'' of
                 associated variants. In conclusion, uncommon or rare genetic
                 variants can easily create synthetic associations that are
                 credited to common variants, and this possibility requires
                 careful consideration in the interpretation and follow up of
                 GWAS signals.",

                 variation maps of human as well as of model organism
                 populations are required. Here, we present a nucleotide
                 resolution catalog of single-nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and
                 structural variants in 39 Drosophila melanogaster Genetic
                 Reference Panel inbred lines. Using an integrative, local
                 assembly-based approach for variant discovery, we identify
                 more than 3.6 million distinct variants, among which were more
                 than 800,000 unique insertions, deletions (indels), and
                 complex variants (1 to 6,000 bp). While the SNP density is
                 higher near other variants, we find that variants themselves
                 are not mutagenic, nor are regions with high variant density
                 particularly mutation-prone. Rather, our data suggest that the
                 elevated SNP density around variants is mainly due to
                 population-level processes. We also provide insights into the
                 regulatory architecture of gene expression variation in adult
                 flies by mapping cis-expression quantitative trait loci
                 (cis-eQTLs) for more than 2,000 genes. Indels comprise around
                 10\% of all cis-eQTLs and show larger effects than SNP
                 cis-eQTLs. In addition, we identified two-fold more gene
                 associations in males as compared to females and found that
                 most cis-eQTLs are sex-specific, revealing a partial

                 well as the importance of genetic factors in mediating
                 sex-biased gene expression. Finally, we performed

  abstract    = "The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the
                 amount of neutral polymorphisms within a species will increase
                 proportionally with the census population size (Nc). However,
                 this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the
                 range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic
                 diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range.
                 Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased
                 efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain
                 this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this
                 hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a
                 direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data
                 from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do
                 this, we relied on the fact that the impact of natural
                 selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local
                 recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low
                 recombination, selected variants affect more neutral sites
                 through linkage, and the resulting correlation between
                 recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative
                 assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on
                 linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome
                 polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling
                 framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection
                 reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately
                 sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the
                 impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc,
                 based on body size and species range as proxies for census
                 population size. These results demonstrate that natural
                 selection removes more variation at linked neutral sites in
                 species with large Nc than those with small Nc and provides
                 direct empirical evidence that natural selection constrains
                 levels of neutral genetic diversity across many species. This
                 implies that natural selection may provide an explanation for
                 this longstanding paradox of population genetics.",

                 suggesting that beneficial substitutions to the genome may be
                 common. All suffer from confounding factors, however, such
                 that the interpretation of the evidence-in particular,
                 conclusions about the rate and strength of beneficial
                 substitutions-remains tentative. Here, we use genome-wide
                 polymorphism data in D. simulans and sequenced genomes of its
                 close relatives to construct a readily interpretable
                 characterization of the effects of positive selection: the
                 shape of average neutral diversity around amino acid
                 substitutions. As expected under recurrent selective sweeps,
                 we find a trough in diversity levels around amino acid but not
                 around synonymous substitutions, a distinctive pattern that is
                 not expected under alternative models. This characterization
                 is richer than previous approaches, which relied on limited
                 summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter plot), and
                 relates to underlying selection parameters in a
                 straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable
                 inferences about the prevalence and strength of adaptation.
                 Specifically, we develop a coalescent-based model for the
                 shape of the entire curve and use it to infer adaptive
                 parameters by maximum likelihood. Our inference suggests that
                 âˆ¼13\% of amino acid substitutions cause selective sweeps.
                 Interestingly, it reveals two classes of beneficial fixations:
                 a minority (approximately 3\%) that appears to have had large
                 selective effects and accounts for most of the reduction in
                 diversity, and the remaining 10\%, which seem to have had very
                 weak selective effects. These estimates therefore help to
                 reconcile the apparent conflict among previously published
                 estimates of the strength of selection. More generally, our
                 findings provide unequivocal evidence for strongly beneficial
                 substitutions in Drosophila and illustrate how the rapidly
                 accumulating genome-wide data can be leveraged to address
                 enduring questions about the genetic basis of adaptation.",

               populations of each species. Patterns of population structure
               differ strongly between the two species. In C. grandiflora, we
               observe an isolation-by-distance pattern and identify three
               clearly delineated genetic groups. In C. rubella, where we
               estimate the selfing rate to be 0.90--0.94, the pattern is less
               clear with some sampling populations forming separate genetic
               clusters while others are highly mixed. The two species also
               have divergent histories. Our analysis gives support for a
               bottleneck approximately 73 kya (20--139 kya) in C. rubella,
               which most likely represents speciation from C. grandiflora. In
               C. grandiflora, there is moderate support for the standard
               neutral model in 2 of 3 genetic clusters, while the third

                 interpreting the many disease-risk variants that fall outside
                 of protein-coding regions. Here, we provide a direct window
                 into the regulatory consequences of genetic variation by
                 sequencing RNA from 922 genotyped individuals. We present a
                 comprehensive description of the distribution of regulatory
                 variation--by the specific expression phenotypes altered, the
                 properties of affected genes, and the genomic characteristics
                 of regulatory variants. We detect variants influencing
                 expression of over ten thousand genes, and through the
                 enhanced resolution offered by RNA-sequencing, for the first
                 time we identify thousands of variants associated with
                 specific phenotypes including splicing and allelic expression.
                 Evaluating the effects of both long-range intra-chromosomal
                 and trans (cross-chromosomal) regulation, we observe
                 modularity in the regulatory network, with three-dimensional
                 chromosomal configuration playing a particular role in
                 regulatory modules within each chromosome. We also observe a
                 significant depletion of regulatory variants affecting central
                 and critical genes, along with a trend of reduced effect sizes
                 as variant frequency increases, providing evidence that
                 purifying selection and buffering have limited the deleterious
                 impact of regulatory variation on the cell. Further,
                 generalizing beyond observed variants, we have analyzed the
                 genomic properties of variants associated with expression and
                 splicing and developed a Bayesian model to predict regulatory
                 consequences of genetic variants, applicable to the
                 interpretation of individual genomes and disease studies.

                 (GWA) mapping of gene expression in an F(1) hybrid diversity
                 panel. At a genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2, an
                 associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) explains >38\%
                 of trait variation. In comparison with SNPs that are distant
                 from the genes to which they were associated, locally
                 associated SNPs are preferentially found in regions with
                 extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) and have distinct
                 population frequencies of the derived alleles (where
                 Arabidopsis lyrata has the ancestral allele), suggesting that
                 different selective forces are acting. Locally associated SNPs
                 tend to have additive inheritance, whereas distantly
                 associated SNPs are primarily dominant. In contrast to results
                 from mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in

                 tool for genome-wide quantification of DNA and RNA. However, a
                 major technical hurdle lies in the need to map short sequence
                 reads back to their correct locations in a reference genome.
                 Here, we investigate the impact of SNP variation on the
                 reliability of read-mapping in the context of detecting
                 allele-specific expression (ASE). RESULTS: We generated 16
                 million 35 bp reads from mRNA of each of two HapMap Yoruba
                 individuals. When we mapped these reads to the human genome we
                 found that, at heterozygous SNPs, there was a significant bias
                 toward higher mapping rates of the allele in the reference
                 sequence, compared with the alternative allele. Masking known
                 SNP positions in the genome sequence eliminated the reference
                 bias but, surprisingly, did not lead to more reliable results
                 overall. We find that even after masking, approximately 5-10\%
                 of SNPs still have an inherent bias toward more effective
                 mapping of one allele. Filtering out inherently biased SNPs
                 removes 40\% of the top signals of ASE. The remaining SNPs
                 showing ASE are enriched in genes previously known to harbor
                 cis-regulatory variation or known to show uniparental
                 imprinting. Our results have implications for a variety of

                 Recently, the genotyping of diverse human populations has led
                 to the identification of many putative ``local adaptations''
                 that differ between populations. Here I show that these local

                 been highlighted as an important mechanism underlying
                 phenotypic variation, but the discovery of genetic
                 interactions in humans has proved difficult. In this study, we
                 show that the spectrum of variation in the human genome has
                 been shaped by modifier effects of cis-regulatory variation on
                 the functional impact of putatively deleterious protein-coding
                 variants. We analyzed 1000 Genomes population-scale
                 resequencing data from Europe (CEU [Utah residents with
                 Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH
                 collection]) and Africa (YRI [Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria])
                 together with gene expression data from arrays and RNA
                 sequencing for the same samples. We observed an
                 underrepresentation of derived putatively functional coding
                 variation on the more highly expressed regulatory haplotype,
                 which suggests stronger purifying selection against
                 deleterious coding variants that have increased penetrance
                 because of their regulatory background. Furthermore, the
                 frequency spectrum and impact size distribution of common
                 regulatory polymorphisms (eQTLs) appear to be shaped in order
                 to minimize the selective disadvantage of having deleterious
                 coding mutations on the more highly expressed haplotype.
                 Interestingly, eQTLs explaining common disease GWAS signals
                 showed an enrichment of putative epistatic effects, suggesting
                 that some disease associations might arise from interactions
                 increasing the penetrance of rare coding variants. In
                 conclusion, our results indicate that regulatory and coding
                 variants often modify the functional impact of each other.
                 This specific type of genetic interaction is detectable from
                 sequencing data in a genome-wide manner, and characterizing
                 these joint effects might help us understand functional

                 adaptive evolution has long been controversial. In principle,
                 the rate and strength of adaptation within functional genetic
                 elements can be quantified on the basis of an excess of
                 nucleotide substitutions between species compared to the
                 neutral expectation or from effects of recent substitutions on
                 nucleotide diversity at linked sites. Here, we infer the
                 nature of selective forces acting in proteins, their UTRs and
                 conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) using genome-wide patterns
                 of diversity in wild house mice and divergence to related
                 species. By applying an extension of the McDonald-Kreitman
                 test, we infer that adaptive substitutions are widespread in
                 protein-coding genes, UTRs and CNEs, and we estimate that
                 there are at least four times as many adaptive substitutions
                 in CNEs and UTRs as in proteins. We observe pronounced
                 reductions in mean diversity around nonsynonymous sites
                 (whether or not they have experienced a recent substitution).
                 This can be explained by selection on multiple, linked CNEs
                 and exons. We also observe substantial dips in mean diversity
                 (after controlling for divergence) around protein-coding exons
                 and CNEs, which can also be explained by the combined effects
                 of many linked exons and CNEs. A model of background selection
                 (BGS) can adequately explain the reduction in mean diversity
                 observed around CNEs. However, BGS fails to explain the wide
                 reductions in mean diversity surrounding exons (encompassing
                 ~100 Kb, on average), implying that there is a substantial
                 role for adaptation within exons or closely linked sites. The
                 wide dips in diversity around exons, which are hard to explain
                 by BGS, suggest that the fitness effects of adaptive amino
                 acid substitutions could be substantially larger than
                 substitutions in CNEs. We conclude that although there appear
                 to be many more adaptive noncoding changes, substitutions in
                 proteins may dominate phenotypic evolution.",

                 a number of enzymes with other biochemical pathways. The six
                 core structural genes of this pathway have been cloned and
                 characterized in two taxonomically diverse plant species
                 (maize and snapdragon). We have recently cloned these genes
                 for a third species, the common morning glory, Ipomoea
                 purpurea. This additional information provides an opportunity
                 to examine patterns of evolution among genes within a single
                 biochemical pathway. We report here that upstream genes in the
                 anthocyanin pathway have evolved substantially more slowly

                 evolutionary rates may be explained by upstream genes being
                 more constrained because they participate in several different
                 biochemical pathways. In addition, regulatory genes associated
                 with the anthocyanin pathway tend to evolve more rapidly than

                 evolution of flower color may be mediated more by regulatory
                 than by structural genes. Finally, for individual anthocyanin
                 genes, we found an absence of rate heterogeneity among three

                 and/or stronger population structure may not be expected to
                 exhibit Drosophila-like patterns of sequence variation. We
                 test this prediction and identify determinants of levels of
                 polymorphism and rates of protein evolution using genomic data
                 from Arabidopsis thaliana and the recently sequenced
                 Arabidopsis lyrata genome. We find that, in contrast to
                 Drosophila, there is no negative relationship between
                 nonsynonymous divergence and silent polymorphism at any
                 spatial scale examined. Instead, synonymous divergence is a
                 major predictor of silent polymorphism, which suggests
                 variation in mutation rate as the main determinant of silent
                 variation. Variation in rates of protein divergence is mainly
                 correlated with gene expression level and breadth, consistent
                 with results for a broad range of taxa, and map-based
                 estimates of recombination rate are only weakly correlated
                 with nonsynonymous divergence. Variation in mutation rates and
                 the strength of purifying selection seem to be major drivers
                 of patterns of polymorphism and divergence in Arabidopsis.
                 Nevertheless, a model allowing for varying negative and
                 positive selection by functional gene category explains the

                 estimate the fraction of adaptive nucleotide substitutions

                 test, that contrast polymorphism and divergence between

                 these inflate polymorphism relative to divergence. Here, we
                 estimate alpha by simultaneously estimating the distribution
                 of fitness effects of new mutations at selected sites from the

                 the magnitude of the population size change and the shape of
                 the distribution of effects of deleterious mutations. We
                 analyze several data sets of protein-coding genes and
                 noncoding regions from hominids and Drosophila. In Drosophila
                 genes, we estimate that approximately 50\% of amino acid
                 substitutions and approximately 20\% of substitutions in
                 introns are adaptive. In protein-coding and noncoding data
                 sets of humans, comparison to macaque sequences reveals little
                 evidence for adaptive substitutions. However, the true
                 frequency of adaptive substitutions in human-coding DNA could
                 be as high as 40\%, because estimates based on current
                 polymorphism may be strongly downwardly biased by a decrease
                 in the effective population size along the human lineage.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Most studies of molecular evolution are focused on
                 individual genes and proteins. However, understanding the
                 design principles and evolutionary properties of molecular
                 networks requires a system-wide perspective. In the present
                 work we connect molecular evolution on the gene level with
                 system properties of a cellular metabolic network. In contrast
                 to protein interaction networks, where several previous
                 studies investigated the molecular evolution of proteins,
                 metabolic networks have a relatively well-defined global
                 function. The ability to consider fluxes in a metabolic
                 network allows us to relate the functional role of each enzyme
                 in a network to its rate of evolution. RESULTS: Our results,
                 based on the yeast metabolic network, demonstrate that
                 important evolutionary processes, such as the fixation of
                 single nucleotide mutations, gene duplications, and gene
                 deletions, are influenced by the structure and function of the
                 network. Specifically, central and highly connected enzymes
                 evolve more slowly than less connected enzymes. Also, enzymes
                 carrying high metabolic fluxes under natural biological
                 conditions experience higher evolutionary constraints. Genes
                 encoding enzymes with high connectivity and high metabolic
                 flux have higher chances to retain duplicates in evolution. In
                 contrast to protein interaction networks, highly connected
                 enzymes are no more likely to be essential compared to less
                 connected enzymes. CONCLUSION: The presented analysis of
                 evolutionary constraints, gene duplication, and essentiality
                 demonstrates that the structure and function of a metabolic
                 network shapes the evolution of its enzymes. Our results

                 regulating physiological responses and developmental
                 processes. Here we examine the evolution of the yeast
                 transcription factors in the context of the structure of the
                 gene regulatory network. RESULTS: In contrast to previous
                 results for the protein-protein interaction and metabolic
                 networks, we find that the position of a gene within the
                 transcription network affects the rate of protein evolution
                 such that more central transcription factors tend to evolve
                 faster. Centrality is also positively correlated with
                 expression variability, suggesting that the higher rate of
                 divergence among central transcription factors may be due to
                 their role in controlling information flow and may be the
                 result of adaptation to changing environmental conditions.
                 Alternatively, more central transcription factors could be
                 more buffered against environmental perturbations and,
                 therefore, less subject to strong purifying selection.
                 Importantly, the relationship between centrality and
                 evolutionary rates is independent of expression level,
                 expression variability and gene essentiality. CONCLUSIONS: Our
                 analysis of the transcription network highlights the role of
                 network structure on protein evolutionary rate. Further, the
                 effect of network centrality on nucleotide divergence is
                 different among the metabolic, protein-protein and
                 transcriptional networks, suggesting that the effect of gene
                 position is dependant on the function of the specific network
                 under study. A better understanding of how these three
                 cellular networks interact with one another may be needed to

              Theory predicts that this mutation-selection balance will result
              in an excess of low-frequency variants and a negative correlation

                 evolution are influenced, to a great extent, by the proportion
                 of amino acid residues that are directly involved in protein
                 function. In agreement with this hypothesis, recent work has
                 shown a negative correlation between evolutionary rates and
                 the number of protein-protein interactions. However, the
                 extent to which the number of protein-protein interactions
                 influences evolutionary rates remains unclear. Here, we
                 address this question at several different levels of
                 evolutionary relatedness. RESULTS: Manually curated data on
                 the number of protein-protein interactions among Saccharomyces
                 cerevisiae proteins was examined for possible correlation with
                 evolutionary rates between S. cerevisiae and
                 Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologs. Only a very weak negative
                 correlation between the number of interactions and
                 evolutionary rate of a protein was observed. Furthermore, no
                 relationship was found between a more general measure of the
                 evolutionary conservation of S. cerevisiae proteins, based on
                 the taxonomic distribution of their homologs, and the number
                 of protein-protein interactions. However, when the proteins
                 from yeast were assorted into discrete bins according to the
                 number of interactions, it turned out that 6.5\% of the
                 proteins with the greatest number of interactions evolved, on
                 average, significantly slower than the rest of the proteins.
                 Comparisons were also performed using protein-protein
                 interaction data obtained with high-throughput analysis of
                 Helicobacter pylori proteins. No convincing relationship
                 between the number of protein-protein interactions and
                 evolutionary rates was detected, either for comparisons of
                 orthologs from two completely sequenced H. pylori strains or
                 for comparisons of H. pylori and Campylobacter jejuni
                 orthologs, even when the proteins were classified into bins by
                 the number of interactions. CONCLUSION: The currently
                 available comparative-genomic data do not support the
                 hypothesis that the evolutionary rates of the majority of
                 proteins substantially depend on the number of protein-protein
                 interactions they are involved in. However, a small fraction
                 of yeast proteins with the largest number of interactions (the
                 hubs of the interaction network) tend to evolve slower than
                 the bulk of the proteins.",

                 single dominant variable linked to the number of translation
                 events which explains 40-fold more variation in evolutionary
                 rate than any other, suggesting that protein evolutionary rate

                 a variety of tools have been developed that support exploring

                 tools that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently
                 available. Most of these tools require as input a target set
                 of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the
                 target set compared to the background set. A few tools also
                 exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter
                 typically rely on simulations or on union-bound correction for
                 assigning statistical significance to the results. RESULTS:
                 GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO
                 terms in ranked lists of genes, without requiring the user to
                 provide explicit target and background sets. This is
                 particularly useful in many typical cases where genomic data
                 may be naturally represented as a ranked list of genes (e.g.
                 by level of expression or of differential expression). GOrilla
                 employs a flexible threshold statistical approach to discover
                 GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a
                 ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical
                 characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG,
                 GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment,
                 taking threshold multiple testing into account without the
                 need for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical
                 analysis of thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in
                 order of seconds. The output of the enrichment analysis is
                 visualized as a hierarchical structure, providing a clear view
                 of the relations between enriched GO terms. CONCLUSION:
                 GOrilla is an efficient GO analysis tool with unique features
                 that make a useful addition to the existing repertoire of GO
                 enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique features and advantages

                 molecular networks, with some occupying more important

                 opposed to downstream in metabolic pathways, because upstream
                 genes are more pleiotropic, being required for a wider range
                 of end products. However, few clear examples of this trend in
                 evolutionary rate variation exist. We examined whether genes
                 involved in plant terpenoid biosynthesis exhibit such a
                 pattern, using data for 40 genes from five fully sequenced
                 angiosperms, Oryza, Vitis, Arabidopsis, Populus, and Ricinus.
                 Our results show that d(N)/d(S) does in fact correlate with
                 pathway position along pathways converting glucose to the
                 terpenoid phytohormones abscissic acid, gibberellic acid (GA),
                 and brassinosteroids. Upstream versus downstream rate
                 variation is particularly strong in the GA pathway. In
                 contrast, we found no or little apparent variation in
                 d(N)/d(S) with gene copy number. We also introduce a new
                 measure of pathway position, the Pathway Pleiotropy Index
                 (PPI), which counts groups of enzymes between pathway branch
                 points. We found that this measure is superior to pathway
                 position in explaining variation in d(N)/d(S) along each
                 pathway. Although at least 8 of the 40 genes showed evidence
                 of positive selection, correlations of d(N)/d(S) with PPI
                 remain significant when these genes are removed. Therefore,
                 our results are consistent with the prediction that selective

                 Recently, however, a critical role for physical principles of
                 network self-organization in biological systems has been
                 revealed. Here, we employ a systems level view of genome-scale
                 sequence and expression data to examine the interplay between
                 these two sources of order, natural selection and physical
                 self-organization, in the evolution of human gene regulation.
                 The topology of a human gene coexpression network, derived
                 from tissue-specific expression profiles, shows scale-free
                 properties that imply evolutionary self-organization via
                 preferential node attachment. Genes with numerous coexpressed
                 partners (the hubs of the coexpression network) evolve more
                 slowly on average than genes with fewer coexpressed partners,
                 and genes that are coexpressed show similar rates of
                 evolution. Thus, the strength of selective constraints on gene
                 sequences is affected by the topology of the gene coexpression
                 network. This connection is strong for the coding regions and
                 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), but the 5' UTRs appear to
                 evolve under a different regime. Surprisingly, we found no
                 connection between the rate of gene sequence divergence and
                 the extent of gene expression profile divergence between human
                 and mouse. This suggests that distinct modes of natural
                 selection might govern sequence versus expression divergence,
                 and we propose a model, based on rapid, adaptation-driven
                 divergence and convergent evolution of gene expression
                 patterns, for how natural selection could influence gene

                 investigate the properties of weighted gene co-expression
                 networks formed from multiple microarray datasets. The
                 constructed networks approximate scale-free topology, but this

                 correlations between gene connectivity within the whole
                 network and gene essentiality as well as gene sequence
                 conservation. We demonstrate the preservation of a modular

                 here on using population genetics to address some key
                 questions in local adaptation: what traits are involved? What
                 environmental variables are the most important? Does local
                 adaptation target the same genes in related species? Do loci
                 responsible for local adaptation exhibit trade-offs across
                 environments? After discussing these questions we highlight
                 important limitations to population genetic analyses including
                 challenges with obtaining high-quality data, deciding which
                 loci are targets of selection, and limits to identifying the

                 enzymes. One characteristic that may affect rate heterogeneity
                 is control of the amount of product produced by a biochemical
                 pathway or flux control. In particular, theoretical analyses
                 suggest that adaptive substitutions should be concentrated in
                 the enzyme(s) that exert the greatest control over flux.
                 Although a handful of studies have found a correlation between
                 position in a pathway and evolutionary rate, these
                 investigations have not examined the relationship between
                 evolutionary rate and flux control. Given that genes with
                 greater control will experience stronger selection and that
                 the probability of fixation is proportional to the selective
                 advantage, we ask the following: 1) do upstream enzymes have
                 majority flux control, 2) do enzymes with majority flux
                 control accumulate adaptive substitutions, and 3) are upstream

                 perturbing the enzymes in the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway

                 that flux control is focused in the first enzyme in the

                 selection, we also show that this enzyme is the only one in
                 the pathway that shows convincing evidence of selection. Our

                 relationship between genetic signatures of adaptive evolution

                 chimpanzee) to be located at the periphery of the interaction
                 network. Our results are based on the analysis of two types of
                 genome evolution, both in terms of intra- and interspecies
                 variation. First, we looked at single-nucleotide polymorphisms
                 and their fixed variants, single-nucleotide differences in the
                 human genome relative to the chimpanzee. Second, we examine
                 fixed structural variants, specifically large segmental
                 duplications and their polymorphic precursors known as copy
                 number variants. We propose two complementary mechanisms that
                 lead to the observed trends. First, we can rationalize them in
                 terms of constraints imposed by protein structure: We find
                 that positively selected sites are preferentially located on
                 the exposed surface of proteins. Because central network
                 proteins (hubs) are likely to have a larger fraction of their
                 surface involved in interactions, they tend to be constrained
                 and under negative selection. Conversely, we show that the
                 interaction network roughly maps to cellular organization,
                 with the periphery of the network corresponding to the
                 cellular periphery (i.e., extracellular space or cell
                 membrane). This suggests that the observed positive selection
                 at the network periphery may be due to an increase of adaptive

                 well as gene expression polymorphism and divergence,
                 protein-protein interactions cannot account for the observed
                 coupling between regulatory and structural evolution.
                 Furthermore, we show that proteins with higher rates of amino
                 acid substitutions tend to have larger sizes and tend to be
                 expressed at lower mRNA abundances, whereas genes with higher
                 levels of gene expression divergence and polymorphism tend to
                 have shorter sizes and tend to be expressed at higher mRNA

                 Discovering the underlying causes of this variation has been a
                 challenge in evolutionary biology. It has been proposed that
                 both the intrinsic properties of enzymes and their pathway
                 position have direct effects on their molecular evolution, and
                 with the genomic era the study of adaptation has been taken to

                 broad-tailed distributions are observed because they confer
                 robustness against mutations to the network. We evaluate this
                 hypothesis for two genetic networks, that of the E. coli core
                 intermediary metabolism and that of the yeast
                 protein-interaction network. Specifically, we test the
                 hypothesis through one of its key predictions: highly
                 connected proteins should be more important to the cell and,
                 thus, subject to more severe selective and evolutionary
                 constraints. We find, however, that no correlation between
                 highly connected proteins and evolutionary rate exists in the

                 genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription show
                 significant correlations. Our work sheds light on conflicting
                 results by previous researchers by comparing data from
                 multiple types of protein-interaction datasets and by using a
                 closely related species as a reference taxon. The finding that

                 increased likelihood of being associated with a common
                 functional module, networks of coexpressed genes provide one
                 framework for assigning gene function. This has informed the
                 guilt-by-association (GBA) heuristic, widely invoked in
                 functional genomics. Yet although the idea of GBA is accepted,
                 the breadth of GBA applicability is uncertain. RESULTS: We
                 developed methods to systematically explore the breadth of GBA
                 across a large and varied corpus of expression data to answer
                 the following question: To what extent is the GBA heuristic
                 broadly applicable to the transcriptome and conversely how
                 broadly is GBA captured by a priori knowledge represented in
                 the Gene Ontology (GO)? Our study provides an investigation of
                 the functional organization of five coexpression networks
                 using data from three mammalian organisms. Our method
                 calculates a probabilistic score between each gene and each
                 Gene Ontology category that reflects coexpression enrichment
                 of a GO module. For each GO category we use Receiver Operating
                 Curves to assess whether these probabilistic scores reflect
                 GBA. This methodology applied to five different coexpression
                 networks demonstrates that the signature of
                 guilt-by-association is ubiquitous and reproducible and that
                 the GBA heuristic is broadly applicable across the population
                 of nine hundred Gene Ontology categories. We also demonstrate

                 force during the adaptation of modern human populations to
                 changing social and other environmental conditions. The
                 evolution of the immune system has therefore been influenced
                 by these pressures. Genomic scans have revealed that immune
                 system is one of the functions enriched with genes under
                 adaptive selection. RESULTS: Here, we describe how the innate
                 immune system has responded to these challenges, through the
                 analysis of resequencing data for 132 innate immunity genes in
                 two human populations. Results are interpreted in the context
                 of the functional and interaction networks defined by these
                 genes. Nucleotide diversity is lower in the adaptors and
                 modulators functional classes, and is negatively correlated
                 with the centrality of the proteins within the interaction
                 network. We also produced a list of candidate genes under
                 positive or balancing selection in each population detected by
                 neutrality tests and showed that some functional classes are
                 preferential targets for selection. CONCLUSIONS: We found

                 identify the factors that cause proteins to evolve at such
                 dramatically different rates. To this end, we estimated the
                 evolutionary rates of >3,000 proteins in four species of the

                 may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at
                 linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant
                 can only remain in a large population for a long period of
                 time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of
                 deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid
                 elimination from the population by selection. Approximate
                 formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral
                 values resulting from such background selection against
                 deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss
                 of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of
                 segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating
                 populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations
                 reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization.
                 For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction
                 is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to
                 deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved.
                 Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with
                 increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The
                 mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total
                 number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to
                 background selection than the other statistics, unless the
                 population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more.
                 The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the
                 neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare
                 alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed
                 reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic

                 centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in

                 But what is the question to which QTNs are the answer?
                 Although their pursuit is often invoked as a means of
                 addressing the molecular basis of phenotypic evolution or of
                 estimating the roles of evolutionary forces, the QTNs that are

                 large-effect variants are unrepresentative of the alleles that
                 matter. Although 20th century evolutionary biology generally
                 viewed large-effect variants as atypical, the field has
                 recently undergone a quiet realignment toward a view of
                 readily discoverable large-effect alleles as the primary
                 molecular substrates for evolution. I argue that neither
                 theory nor data justify this realignment. Models and
                 experimental findings covering broad swaths of evolutionary
                 phenomena suggest that evolution often acts via large numbers
                 of small-effect polygenes, individually undetectable.
                 Moreover, these small-effect variants are different in kind,
                 at the molecular level, from the large-effect alleles
                 accessible to experimentalists. Although discoverable QTNs
                 address some fundamental evolutionary questions, they are

                 evolutionary fate of small populations. Properties of the DFE
                 can be inferred by comparing the distributions of the
                 frequencies of segregating nucleotide polymorphisms at
                 selected and neutral sites in a population sample, but
                 demographic changes alter the spectrum of allele frequencies
                 at both neutral and selected sites, so can bias estimates of
                 the DFE if not accounted for. We have developed a
                 maximum-likelihood approach, based on the expected
                 allele-frequency distribution generated by transition matrix
                 methods, to estimate parameters of the DFE while
                 simultaneously estimating parameters of a demographic model

                 populations, we estimate that the shape parameter is
                 approximately 0.35. Differences in the shape of the

              genome. Much of the remaining 99\% has been long assumed to be
              junk DNA, with little or no functional significance. Here, we
              show that in hominids, a group with historically low effective
              population sizes, all classes of noncoding DNA evolve more slowly
              than ancestral transposable elements and so appear to be subject
              to significant evolutionary constraints. Under the nearly neutral
              theory, we expected to see lower levels of selective constraints
              on most sequence types in hominids than murids, a group that is
              thought to have a higher effective population size. We found that
              this is the case for many sequence types examined, the most
              extreme example being 5â€²UTRs, for which constraint in hominids is
              only about one-third that of murids. Surprisingly, however, we
              observed higher constraints for some sequence types in hominids,
              notably 4-fold sites, where constraint is more than twice as high
              as in murids. This implies that more than about one-fifth of
              mutations at 4-fold sites are effectively selected against in
              hominids. The higher constraint at 4-fold sites in hominids
              suggests a more complex protein-coding gene structure than murids
              and indicates that methods for detecting selection on
              protein-coding sequences (e.g., using the dN/dS ratio), with
              4-fold sites as a neutral standard, may lead to biased estimates,
              particularly in hominids. Our constraint estimates imply that
              5.4\% of nucleotide sites in the human genome are subject to
              effective negative selection and that there are three times as
              many constrained sites within noncoding sequences as within
              protein-coding sequences. Including coding and noncoding sites,
              we estimate that the genomic deleterious mutation rate U = 4.2.

                 for patterns of polymorphism in the presence of both
                 population size change and natural selection. If data are
                 available from different functional classes of variation, and
                 a priori information suggests that mutations in one of those
                 classes are selectively neutral, then the putatively neutral
                 class can be used to infer demographic parameters, and
                 inferences regarding selection on other classes can be

                 Theory suggests that selection at linked sites should affect
                 patterns of neutral variation in partially selfing populations
                 more dramatically than in outcrossing populations. However,
                 empirical investigations of selection at linked sites have
                 focused primarily on outcrossing species. To assess the
                 potential role of selection as a determinant of neutral
                 polymorphism in the context of partial self-fertilization, we
                 conducted a multivariate analysis of single-nucleotide
                 polymorphism (SNP) density throughout the genome of the
                 nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We based the analysis on a

                 densities across all six chromosomes. Our analyses identify a

                 neutral polymorphism (as estimated by noncoding SNP density)

                 levels of neutral polymorphism are lower in gene-dense regions

                 incorporating local estimates of divergence between C. elegans

                 rate and SNP density, but only when they incorporate selfing

                 substantial deviations from the classical pattern of a
                 selective sweep from a single new mutation. Deviations from
                 neutrality in the level of polymorphism and in the frequency
                 spectrum are much less pronounced than in the classical sweep
                 pattern. In contrast, for levels of LD, the signature is even
                 stronger if recurrent beneficial mutation plays a role. We
                 suggest a variant of existing LD tests that increases their

               populations and species is a poorly explored but currently
               growing field of research. Here, we review 31 experimental and
               14 comparative studies and first investigate whether there is
               empirical support for the propositions that higher levels of
               among-individual phenotypic and genetic variation promote the
               ecological and evolutionary success of populations and species
               in the face of environmental change. Next, we examine whether
               and how the effect of diversity depends on environmental
               conditions. Finally, we explore whether the relationship linking
               population fitness to diversity is typically linear, asymptotic,
               or whether the benefits peak at intermediate diversity. The
               reviewed studies provide strong, almost invariable, evidence
               that more variable populations are less vulnerable to
               environmental changes, show decreased fluctuations in population
               size, have superior establishment success, larger distribution

               variable populations or species. Given the overwhelming evidence

               under benign conditions. Finally, population performance
               increased linearly with increasing diversity in the majority (10
               of 12) of manipulation studies that included four or more

                 the rate and strength of adaptation within functional genetic
                 elements can be quantified on the basis of an excess of
                 nucleotide substitutions between species compared to the
                 neutral expectation or from effects of recent substitutions on
                 nucleotide diversity at linked sites. Here, we infer the
                 nature of selective forces acting in proteins, their UTRs and
                 conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) using genome-wide patterns
                 of diversity in wild house mice and divergence to related
                 species. By applying an extension of the McDonald-Kreitman
                 test, we infer that adaptive substitutions are widespread in
                 protein-coding genes, UTRs and CNEs, and we estimate that
                 there are at least four times as many adaptive substitutions
                 in CNEs and UTRs as in proteins. We observe pronounced
                 reductions in mean diversity around nonsynonymous sites
                 (whether or not they have experienced a recent substitution).
                 This can be explained by selection on multiple, linked CNEs
                 and exons. We also observe substantial dips in mean diversity
                 (after controlling for divergence) around protein-coding exons
                 and CNEs, which can also be explained by the combined effects
                 of many linked exons and CNEs. A model of background selection
                 (BGS) can adequately explain the reduction in mean diversity
                 observed around CNEs. However, BGS fails to explain the wide
                 reductions in mean diversity surrounding exons (encompassing
                 ~100 Kb, on average), implying that there is a substantial
                 role for adaptation within exons or closely linked sites. The
                 wide dips in diversity around exons, which are hard to explain
                 by BGS, suggest that the fitness effects of adaptive amino
                 acid substitutions could be substantially larger than
                 substitutions in CNEs. We conclude that although there appear

                 proposes that mapping efforts should focus on identification
                 of susceptibility mutations that are relatively old and at
                 high frequency. It is generally assumed-at least for modeling
                 purposes-that selection against complex disease mutations is
                 so weak that it can be ignored. In this article, I propose an
                 explicit model for the evolution of complex disease loci,
                 incorporating mutation, random genetic drift, and the
                 possibility of purifying selection against susceptibility
                 mutations. I show that, for the most plausible range of
                 mutation rates, neutral susceptibility alleles are unlikely to
                 be at intermediate frequencies and contribute little to the
                 overall genetic variance for the disease. Instead, it seems
                 likely that the bulk of genetic variance underlying diseases
                 is due to loci where susceptibility mutations are mildly
                 deleterious and where there is a high overall mutation rate to

                 amino-acid (A) to synonymous (S) polymorphism should, on

                   variation at linked sites. Quantifying the effects of
                   'linked selection' on levels of genetic diversity is key to
                   making reliable inference about demography, building a null
                   model in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about
                   the dynamics of natural selection. Here, we introduce the
                   first method that jointly infers parameters of distinct
                   modes of linked selection, notably background selection and
                   selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data,
                   functional annotations and genetic maps. The central idea is
                   to calculate the probability that a neutral site is
                   polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns,
                   and recombination rates. Information is then combined across
                   sites and samples using composite likelihood in order to
                   estimate genome-wide parameters of distinct modes of
                   selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this
                   approach yields a map of the expected neutral diversity
                   levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of our
                   approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from
                   125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict
                   diversity levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate
                   estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in
                   proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They allow us to
                   distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other
                   modes of selection around amino acid substitutions and to
                   uncover evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated
                   regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a substantial
                   effect of linked selection from non-classic sweeps. More
                   generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a
                   larger effect in reducing diversity levels and increasing
                   their variance in D. melanogaster than previously

                 the McDonald-Kreitman test. However, little is known about
                 associated selection coefficients of beneficial amino acid

                 substitutions should leave a characteristic signature in
                 genome variability data that contains information about the
                 frequency and strength of selection. Here, I document a
                 significant negative correlation between the level and the
                 frequency of synonymous site polymorphism and the rate of
                 protein evolution in highly recombining regions of the X

                 recurrent adaptive protein evolution and suggests that
                 adaptation is an important determinant of patterns of neutral

                 24 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives.
                 Together with data from Drosophila simulans, these data reveal
                 the following. (i) Approximately 10\% of the loci in regions
                 of normal recombination are much less polymorphic at silent
                 sites than expected, hinting at the action of selective
                 sweeps. (ii) The level of polymorphism is negatively
                 correlated with the rate of nonsynonymous divergence across
                 loci. Thus, even under strict neutrality, the ratio of amino
                 acid to silent nucleotide changes (A:S) between Drosophila
                 species is expected to be 25-40\% higher than the A:S ratio
                 for polymorphism when data are pooled across the genome. (iii)
                 The observed A/S ratio between species among the 419 loci is
                 28.9\% higher than the (adjusted) neutral expectation. We
                 estimate that nearly 30\% of the amino acid substitutions
                 between D. melanogaster and its close relatives were adaptive.
                 (iv) This signature of adaptive evolution is observable only
                 in regions of normal recombination. Hence, the low level of
                 polymorphism observed in regions of reduced recombination may
                 not be driven primarily by positive selection. Finally, we
                 discuss the theories and data pertaining to the interpretation

                 advantage and recurrence rate of the sweeps. Because many
                 adaptive substitutions responsible for these sweeps also
                 contribute to nonsynonymous divergence, the spatial
                 distribution of nonsynonymous divergence also reflects the

                 correspondence between neutral polymorphism and nonsynonymous
                 divergence may be especially informative about the process of
                 adaptation. Here we study this correspondence using genomewide
                 polymorphism data from Drosophila simulans and the divergence
                 between D. simulans and D. melanogaster. Focusing on highly
                 recombining portions of the autosomes, at a spatial scale

                 divergence is higher and that the spatial structure of this

                 suggest that many adaptations are of surprisingly great
