  abstract    = "The goal of identifying the genes or even nucleotides
                 underlying quantitative and adaptive traits has been
                 characterized as the 'QTN programme' and has recently come
                 under severe criticism. Part of the reason for this criticism
                 is that much of the QTN programme has asserted that finding
                 the genes and nucleotides for adaptive and quantitative traits
                 is a fundamental goal, without explaining why it is such a
                 hallowed goal. Here we outline motivations for the QTN
                 programme that offer general insight, regardless of whether
                 QTNs are of large or small effect, and that aid our
                 understanding of the mechanistic dynamics of adaptive
                 evolution. We focus on five areas: (i) vertical integration of
                 insight across different levels of biological organization,
                 (ii) genetic parallelism and the role of pleiotropy in shaping
                 evolutionary dynamics, (iii) understanding the forces
                 maintaining genetic variation in populations, (iv)
                 distinguishing between adaptation from standing variation and
                 new mutation, and (v) the role of genomic architecture in
                 facilitating adaptation. We argue that rather than abandoning
                 the QTN programme, we should refocus our efforts on topics
                 where molecular data will be the most effective for testing
                 hypotheses about phenotypic evolution.",

                 directly on levels or patterns of gene expression. In order to
                 test whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
                 affect gene expression in cis are frequently targets of
                 positive natural selection in humans, we analyzed genome-wide
                 SNP and expression data from cell lines associated with the
                 International HapMap Project. Using a haplotype-based test for
                 selection that was designed to detect incomplete selective
                 sweeps, we found that SNPs showing signals of selection are
                 more likely than random SNPs to be associated with gene
                 expression levels in cis. This signal is significant in the
                 Yoruba (which is the population that shows the strongest
                 signals of selection overall) and shows a trend in the same
                 direction in the other HapMap populations. Our results argue
                 that selection on gene expression levels is an important type
                 of human adaptation. Finally, our work provides an analytical
                 framework for tackling a more general problem that will become
                 increasingly important: namely, testing whether selection
                 signals overlap significantly with SNPs that are associated

                 adaptive evolution within protein-coding genes in a variety of
                 species. However, with the exception of Drosophila and humans,
                 little is known about the extent of adaptive evolution in
                 noncoding DNA. Here, we study regions upstream and downstream
                 of protein-coding genes in the house mouse Mus musculus
                 castaneus, a species that has a much larger effective
                 population size (N(e)) than humans. We analyze polymorphism
                 data for 78 genes from 15 wild-caught M. m. castaneus
                 individuals and divergence to a closely related species, Mus
                 famulus. We find high levels of nucleotide diversity and
                 moderate levels of selective constraint in upstream and
                 downstream regions compared with nonsynonymous sites of
                 protein-coding genes. From the polymorphism data, we estimate
                 the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations and
                 infer that most new mutations in upstream and downstream
                 regions behave as effectively neutral and that only a small
                 fraction is strongly negatively selected. We also estimate the
                 fraction of substitutions that have been driven to fixation by
                 positive selection ($\alpha$) and the ratio of adaptive to
                 neutral divergence ($\omega$($\alpha$)). We find that $\alpha$
                 for upstream and downstream regions (∼ 10\%) is much lower
                 than $\alpha$ for nonsynonymous sites (∼ 50\%). However,
                 $\omega$($\alpha$) estimates are very similar for
                 nonsynonymous sites (∼ 10\%) and upstream and downstream
                 regions (∼ 5\%). We conclude that negative selection operating
                 in upstream and downstream regions of M. m. castaneus is weak
                 and that the low values of $\alpha$ for upstream and
                 downstream regions relative to nonsynonymous sites are most
                 likely due to the presence of a higher proportion of neutrally
                 evolving sites and not due to lower absolute rates of adaptive
                 substitution.",

                 modern data sets imposes severe computational challenges.
                 Here, we develop efficient algorithms for approximate
                 inference of the model underlying the STRUCTURE program using
                 a variational Bayesian framework. Variational methods pose the
                 problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an
                 optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances
                 in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In
                 addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the
                 number of populations represented in a data set and a new
                 hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the

                 illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH-Human Genome

                 three studies for more than 500,000 SNPs and 42 environmental
                 factors, including climate, subsistence, pathogens, and
                 dietary patterns, we performed a systematic examination of the
                 adaptive patterns of eQTLs to local environment. Compared with

                 we estimate that 40\% of amino acid substitutions were fixed
                 by positive selection in this species, and we also infer a low

                 that variants are functional based on their genomic locations
                 and then use whole-genome sequence data from 29 subjects of

                 functional properties of variants and their population allele

                 the study, no QTLs were detected for 40\% of highly heritable

                 assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays,
                 recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of
                 transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced
                 RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated
                 Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by

                 least 2,000 common variants that appear associated with common
                 diseases or related traits (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies),
                 hundreds of which have been convincingly replicated. It is
                 generally thought that the associated markers reflect the
                 effect of a nearby common (minor allele frequency >0.05)
                 causal site, which is associated with the marker, leading to
                 extensive resequencing efforts to find causal sites. We
                 propose as an alternative explanation that variants much less
                 common than the associated one may create ``synthetic
                 associations'' by occurring, stochastically, more often in
                 association with one of the alleles at the common site versus
                 the other allele. Although synthetic associations are an
                 obvious theoretical possibility, they have never been
                 systematically explored as a possible explanation for GWAS
                 findings. Here, we use simple computer simulations to show the
                 conditions under which such synthetic associations will arise
                 and how they may be recognized. We show that they are not only
                 possible, but inevitable, and that under simple but reasonable
                 genetic models, they are likely to account for or contribute
                 to many of the recently identified signals reported in
                 genome-wide association studies. We also illustrate the
                 behavior of synthetic associations in real datasets by showing
                 that rare causal mutations responsible for both hearing loss
                 and sickle cell anemia create genome-wide significant
                 synthetic associations, in the latter case extending over a
                 2.5-Mb interval encompassing scores of ``blocks'' of
                 associated variants. In conclusion, uncommon or rare genetic
                 variants can easily create synthetic associations that are
                 credited to common variants, and this possibility requires
                 careful consideration in the interpretation and follow up of

                 variation maps of human as well as of model organism
                 populations are required. Here, we present a nucleotide
                 resolution catalog of single-nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and
                 structural variants in 39 Drosophila melanogaster Genetic
                 Reference Panel inbred lines. Using an integrative, local
                 assembly-based approach for variant discovery, we identify
                 more than 3.6 million distinct variants, among which were more
                 than 800,000 unique insertions, deletions (indels), and
                 complex variants (1 to 6,000 bp). While the SNP density is
                 higher near other variants, we find that variants themselves

                 particularly mutation-prone. Rather, our data suggest that the

                 well as the importance of genetic factors in mediating
                 sex-biased gene expression. Finally, we performed

                 amount of neutral polymorphisms within a species will increase
                 proportionally with the census population size (Nc). However,
                 this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the
                 range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic
                 diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range.
                 Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased
                 efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain
                 this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this
                 hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a
                 direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data
                 from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do
                 this, we relied on the fact that the impact of natural
                 selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local
                 recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low
                 recombination, selected variants affect more neutral sites
                 through linkage, and the resulting correlation between
                 recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative
                 assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on
                 linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole genome
                 polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling
                 framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection
                 reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately
                 sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the
                 impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc,
                 based on body size and species range as proxies for census
                 population size. These results demonstrate that natural
                 selection removes more variation at linked neutral sites in
                 species with large Nc than those with small Nc and provides
                 direct empirical evidence that natural selection constrains
                 levels of neutral genetic diversity across many species. This
                 implies that natural selection may provide an explanation for
                 this longstanding paradox of population genetics.",

               differ strongly between the two species. In C. grandiflora, we
               observe an isolation-by-distance pattern and identify three
               clearly delineated genetic groups. In C. rubella, where we
               estimate the selfing rate to be 0.90--0.94, the pattern is less

                 properties of affected genes, and the genomic characteristics
                 of regulatory variants. We detect variants influencing
                 expression of over ten thousand genes, and through the
                 enhanced resolution offered by RNA-sequencing, for the first
                 time we identify thousands of variants associated with

                 chromosomal configuration playing a particular role in
                 regulatory modules within each chromosome. We also observe a
                 significant depletion of regulatory variants affecting central

                 panel. At a genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2, an
                 associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) explains >38\%
                 of trait variation. In comparison with SNPs that are distant
                 from the genes to which they were associated, locally
                 associated SNPs are preferentially found in regions with
                 extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) and have distinct

                 reads back to their correct locations in a reference genome.
                 Here, we investigate the impact of SNP variation on the
                 reliability of read-mapping in the context of detecting
                 allele-specific expression (ASE). RESULTS: We generated 16
                 million 35 bp reads from mRNA of each of two HapMap Yoruba
                 individuals. When we mapped these reads to the human genome we
                 found that, at heterozygous SNPs, there was a significant bias
                 toward higher mapping rates of the allele in the reference
                 sequence, compared with the alternative allele. Masking known
                 SNP positions in the genome sequence eliminated the reference
                 bias but, surprisingly, did not lead to more reliable results
                 overall. We find that even after masking, approximately 5-10\%
                 of SNPs still have an inherent bias toward more effective
                 mapping of one allele. Filtering out inherently biased SNPs
                 removes 40\% of the top signals of ASE. The remaining SNPs
                 showing ASE are enriched in genes previously known to harbor
                 cis-regulatory variation or known to show uniparental
                 imprinting. Our results have implications for a variety of

                 negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection
                 to lowly expressed genes. Overall, we observe widespread
                 positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory
                 regions, but our results also suggest that both positive and
                 negative selection on plant noncoding sequence are
                 considerably rarer than in animal genomes.",

                 relative roles of protein-coding versus gene expression
                 changes--has long been the subject of speculation and debate.
                 Recently, the genotyping of diverse human populations has led
                 to the identification of many putative ``local adaptations''
                 that differ between populations. Here I show that these local
                 adaptations are over 10-fold more likely to affect gene
                 expression than amino acid sequence. In addition, a novel
                 framework for identifying polygenic local adaptations detects
                 recent positive selection on the expression levels of genes
                 involved in UV radiation response, immune cell proliferation,
                 and diabetes-related pathways. These results provide the first
                 examples of polygenic gene expression adaptation in humans, as
                 well as the first genome-scale support for the hypothesis that
                 changes in gene expression have driven human adaptation.",

                 been highlighted as an important mechanism underlying
                 phenotypic variation, but the discovery of genetic
                 interactions in humans has proved difficult. In this study, we
                 show that the spectrum of variation in the human genome has
                 been shaped by modifier effects of cis-regulatory variation on
                 the functional impact of putatively deleterious protein-coding
                 variants. We analyzed 1000 Genomes population-scale
                 resequencing data from Europe (CEU [Utah residents with
                 Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH
                 collection]) and Africa (YRI [Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria])
                 together with gene expression data from arrays and RNA
                 sequencing for the same samples. We observed an
                 underrepresentation of derived putatively functional coding
                 variation on the more highly expressed regulatory haplotype,
                 which suggests stronger purifying selection against
                 deleterious coding variants that have increased penetrance
                 because of their regulatory background. Furthermore, the
                 frequency spectrum and impact size distribution of common
                 regulatory polymorphisms (eQTLs) appear to be shaped in order
                 to minimize the selective disadvantage of having deleterious
                 coding mutations on the more highly expressed haplotype.
                 Interestingly, eQTLs explaining common disease GWAS signals
                 showed an enrichment of putative epistatic effects, suggesting
                 that some disease associations might arise from interactions
                 increasing the penetrance of rare coding variants. In
                 conclusion, our results indicate that regulatory and coding
                 variants often modify the functional impact of each other.
                 This specific type of genetic interaction is detectable from
                 sequencing data in a genome-wide manner, and characterizing
                 these joint effects might help us understand functional
                 mechanisms behind genetic associations to human
                 phenotypes-including both Mendelian and common disease.",
